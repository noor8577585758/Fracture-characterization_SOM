# K-Mean-Clustering-for-facies-classification
Clastic reservoirs pose an inherent challenge in facies characterization due to varied depositional energies. 
This efficient log-based workflow minimizes interpretation time and assists in confident facies prediction (>90%) for analog clastic reservoirs.
